     DESCRIPTION:
      Calculates carbon monoxide solubility (K0) in units of mol L-1 atm-1. 
      Equivalent to the dissloved concentration in equilibrium with a pure CO 
      pressure of 101325 Pa (1.0 atm) This function uses the solubility 
      coefficients from Weisenburg and Guinasso fit to data from Douglas (1967) 
      and Winkler (1906).     
    
     INPUT:  
      SP  =  Practical Salinity  (PSS-78)                         [ unitless ]
      pt  =  potential temperature (ITS-90) referenced               [ deg C ]
             to one standard atmosphere (0 dbar).
    
      SP & pt need to have the same dimensions.
    
     OUTPUT:
      COsol = solubility of carbon monoxide                   [ mol L-1 atm-1 ]
